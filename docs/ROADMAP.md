# Roadmap

The project advances by coherent executable slices rather than placeholder subsystems.

1. **Deterministic core** — canonical state, typed events, validation, replay, memory tiers, persistent CLI demo. **Complete.**
2. **Real LLM provider** — replaceable OpenAI-compatible narration, constrained `ScenePlan` input, offline transport tests, and provider-failure atomicity. **Complete.**
3. **Structured LLM action parsing** — strict typed action JSON, visible-state-only prompt surface, deterministic fallback, and resolver-enforced legality. **Complete.**
4. **Mystery graph** — deterministic clue dependencies, replayable inference provenance, observer-scoped contradictions, and discovery gates. **Complete.**
5. **NPC autonomous planning** — structured goals, epistemically scoped planning contexts, bounded typed intents, deterministic NPC resolution, and replayable goal progress. **Complete.**
6. **World simulation between player turns** — canonical simulation cursor, replayable cadence markers, bounded catch-up, and time-aware off-screen NPC consequences. **Complete.**
7. **Vector/embedding retrieval** — optional vector cosine reranking over persisted episodes, deterministic fallback, malformed-output rejection, and no truth authority. **Complete.**
8. **Local-model support / Ollama** — explicit Ollama narration/action-parser presets, local defaults, namespaced configuration, and offline transport tests. **Complete.**
9. **Web API** — stable service boundary over the core engine. **Next.**
10. **Web UI** — presentation layer over persisted sessions.
11. **Model routing / cost controls** — per-stage provider selection, budgets, and caching.
12. **Evaluation harness for 1,000+ turn consistency** — repeatable long-run continuity metrics and adversarial scenarios.

## Milestone 3 invariant

The parser never receives mutation authority:

```text
freeform player text
→ visible interaction surface only
→ provider proposes strict PlayerAction JSON
→ Pydantic schema validation (extra fields forbidden)
→ deterministic resolver
→ ordinary event / validation / commit pipeline
```

Provider request/response failures fall back to the deterministic command parser. A syntactically valid but impossible model-proposed action is rejected by the resolver without changing canonical state or appending material events.

## Milestone 4 invariant

Mystery reasoning is canonical and replayable rather than prose-derived:

```text
known canonical facts
→ discovery prerequisite gate
→ deterministic inference rule
→ FactInferred(rule_id + premise_fact_ids)
→ ordinary event validation / reducer / persistence
```

Derived facts cannot be injected as ordinary `FactDiscovered` events. Inference events must match a registered rule exactly, the observer must already know every premise, and the conclusion must be marked `discoverability="inferred"`. Contradictions are computed from each observer's own knowledge set, so player/NPC epistemic boundaries remain intact.

## Milestone 5 invariant

NPC planning is an intent layer, never a mutation layer:

```text
NPC structured goals + own knowledge + local observations
→ bounded NPCPlanningContext
→ typed NPCPlan / NPCIntent
→ deterministic NPC resolver
→ ordinary validated domain events
→ persistence / replay
```

The planner never receives the full `WorldState`. Its context contains only the NPC's own known facts/beliefs/relationships, configured goals, current location, local exits, visible NPCs/items, inventory, and blocking status. A global `max_actions` budget counts attempted intents, not only successful actions. Goal completion is canonical and replayable through `NPCGoalCompleted`, while movement and discovered facts still pass the normal validator/reducer path.

## Milestone 6 invariant

World simulation decides *when* autonomous phases run without becoming a mutation authority:

```text
accepted player events advance canonical clock
→ deterministic scheduler reads SimulationState cursor
→ bounded due-cycle list
→ off-screen NPC planner / deterministic resolver
→ ordinary validated NPC events
→ SimulationCycleProcessed cursor marker
→ one atomic player-turn commit
```

The scheduler never mutates state directly. `SimulationCycleProcessed` must match the exact canonical cursor and cannot be applied before world time reaches that minute. Automatic cycles skip NPCs currently co-located with the player, preventing hidden background execution from invalidating an interaction that is visibly in progress. Catch-up is bounded per player turn, and backlog remains explicit in the cursor for later turns. Off-screen NPC identities and private consequences are not copied into the player-facing turn/episode memory surface.

## Milestone 7 invariant

Vector retrieval is a ranking aid, never a source of truth:

```text
persisted candidate episodes
→ deterministic baseline ranking inputs
→ optional EmbeddingBackend(query + existing episode summaries)
→ validated fixed-width finite vectors
→ cosine score blended with deterministic score
→ bounded episode list
```

The embedding backend cannot return episode IDs or facts, so it cannot inject new memory objects. Canonical semantic facts remain sourced only from the observer's already-known fact IDs. Wrong vector counts, inconsistent dimensions, non-finite values, and backend exceptions discard semantic enrichment and fall back to deterministic ranking. The built-in feature-hashing backend is deterministic, dependency-free, and keeps CI offline.

## Milestone 8 invariant

Local-model support is a configuration/routing preset, not a new authority path:

```text
provider/parser name = ollama
→ namespaced Ollama configuration
→ default http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
→ existing OpenAICompatibleClient transport
→ existing narration or action-parser boundary
→ deterministic resolver / transactional engine unchanged
```

`EMERGENT_RPG_OLLAMA_MODEL` is explicit and required; base URL, proxy API key, timeout, temperature, and token budget have separate `EMERGENT_RPG_OLLAMA_*` controls. The preset does not inherit generic `EMERGENT_RPG_LLM_API_KEY`, preventing accidental credential bleed into a local endpoint. CI uses injected fake transport and never requires a live Ollama daemon.

## Promotion gate for Milestone 9

The Web API must be a thin service boundary over `GameEngine`, not a second game engine. HTTP handlers may validate/serialize requests, select an existing provider/parser mode, and expose persisted session/state/history operations, but all state transitions must continue through the same resolver/event/validator/persistence pipeline. API tests must run in-process/offline and prove malformed requests or provider failures cannot partially mutate a session.
